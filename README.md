## Train the Model
To train the model from scratch:
1. Run `sh tt_[dataset]_2025.sh` to execute Stage 1.
2. After Stage 1 completes, edit the `models` field in `conf/config_[dataset]_[number]_2025.yaml`, changing
`2G-GCN_stage1_xxxxx` to `2G-GCN_stage2_xxxxx` for Stage 2.
3. Run `sh tt_[dataset]_2025.sh` again to execute Stage 2.

## Test the Model
Example on MPHOI-72: Once you have obtained the pre-trained models for all subject groups, you can get the cross-validation results by running: 
```bash
mkdir visualizations # If you haven't created the directory yet

python predict_2025.py \
--pretrained_model_dir "./outputs_hiergat/mphoi/2G-GCN/hs512_e40_bs8_lr0.0001_0.3_Subject14" \
--save_visualisations_dir "./visualizations" \
--cross_validate
```
